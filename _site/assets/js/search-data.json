    "content": "# Geocoding and Web Mapping {: .no_toc } {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} # Learning Objectives: * Gain Familiarity with Geocoding * Make a Simple Web-Map * Earn Extra Credit! # Geocoding The process of attributing coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) to descriptive locations (Street Address). We can use a variety of web based services (google maps, ESRI, mapbox, open street map, etc.) to perform geocoding. We're using Mapbox today because it strikes a good balance between accessibility and accuracy. ## Google Maps {: .no_toc } Arguably the best geocoding service, but it costs money :/ [5.00 USD per 1000 request](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview). ## ArcGIS World Geocoder {: .no_toc } You can geocode in ArcGIS Pro. You can find a simple tutorial [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geocoding/tutorial-geocode-a-table-of-addresses.htm) and more information [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geocoding/convert-a-table-to-locations-on-the-map.htm) if you need to geocode for your final proejct. Feel free to give it a shot on your own time if you want. The reason I am **not** fond of using ArcGIS Pro to geocode: ESRI geocoding services uses a [credit](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/credits/overview?rsource=%2Fsoftware%2Farcgis%2Farcgisonline%2Fcredits) based system for geocoding because it is a \"premium\" service. As a student, you get something like 1,000 credits, which is easy to go through quickly. You can get more if you request them from Jose, but its inconvenient, and Jose only has a limited number to give out. It makes learning/troubleshooting difficult. ## Mapbox {: .no_toc } A \"freemium\" service up to [100,000 requests per month](https://www.mapbox.com/pricing/#geocode) and gives fairly reliable results. This is what we will be using. It requires you to create a free [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) account. Once you have an account, you will be given an [access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/). Which lets you use the Mapbox's services. We are going to be using Mapbox's Application Programming Interface([API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/)) which lets us programmatically access Mapbox tools and services. You can use these APIs to retrieve information about your account, upload and change resources, use core Mapbox tools, and etc. # Web Mapping Web mapping takes cartography beyond static maps. It allows us to create dynamic, interactive web maps that can be embedded in webpages! ## ArcGIS Online {: .no_toc } ESRI has a platform called [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html). If you're interested in learning about it, my colleague Maya at the UBC Library Research Commons has created this [workshop](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-AGOL/). You can look through this page if you're interested in learning how to use it. ## Leaflet {: .no_toc } [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is an open-source (free) JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms and has a well-documented [API](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html). We are going to use a Python package called [follium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) to \"communicate\" with Leaflet and make some simple web maps like this.

But it is not the only language. Just as English, Cantonese, or Punjabi can all be used to write a paper; Python, Javascirpt, or R can all be used to make a map. I like python because its very flexible, fairly easy to read / write, well suited for data analysis, has lots of packages for GIS, and it's completely free! You will not be expected to know any code or learn how to code. I just want to introduce you all to some the possibilities. ",

    "content": "# Redlining During the course introduction I said that GIS has historically been used as a tool of oppression in settler societies. What did I mean by that? * History is filled with examples of GISystems being used by those in power to influence, direct, or dictate polices and practices that harm marginalized communities. * In some cases, the negative impacts are untended consequences. In many others, the negative impact is the intended result. ## A Prominent Historical Example [Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) is the systematic denial of services to racially marginalized groups by government and lending institutions in order to forcibly segregated communities. For much of the 20th century, redlining was legal and wide spread across North American cities. The practice has been more thoroughly documented and researched in the US. * The video below gives a thorough overview of the practice and how its negative impacts. * It is very important to note that [redlining occurred in Canada as well](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43100660). In your own words, describe what the practice of redlining was and discuss some of its long lasting impacts? ",

Your \"Lab\" for this week is just to follow along through this tutorial and answer the respective questions. ## Getting Setup: Download the Code and Data **1**{: .label .label-red } **Start a Jupyter Lab** UBC provides server space where you can run Python using [Jupyter Lab](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter). Login with your CWL. You'll then be taken to a blank jupyter lab. * This is good option for getting your bearings because nearly everything is already set up. You don't have to worry about installing anything on your own system. * This may sound intimidating/confusing. But don't worry, its easy. You don't need to know command line to do this. I'll walk you through step by step. You can also refer to the video below for help **2**{: .label .label-red } **Open a terminal** We're going to open a command terminal and use command line clone the Github workshop's repository. * In they Jupyter window, click File>\"New\" in the top right and select \"Terminal\" from the drop-down menu. **3**{: .label .label-red } **Clone the Repository** Cloning tells Git (a file tracking software) to download a repository (collection of code, data, etc.) for this workshop. In the new terminal window that opens, paste this command and hit enter: git clone https://github.com/GEOS270/Module7 A folder called Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python should now be visible. You can explore it using file viewer on the left, or you can use the command line (see video). **4**{: .label .label-red } **Installing a Package** In the terminal window type the command below and hit enter to install the geopy package pip install geopy **5**{: .label .label-red } **Opening a Jupyter Notebook** In the file viewer You will notice a folder with the same name as the repository you just cloned, double clicking the folder will open it. You'll see a folders and a collection of files. The one we'll be working in is called \"Python_Notebooks\". Double click to enter. * The .ipynb tag on the end denotes a Jupyter \"Notebook\" * A Notebook is a collection of Python code and annotations that can be run interactively. * Double click on \"Geocoding and Webmapping.ipynb\" to open it. ## Video Reference This video covers the above steps. **Note** the video is for a workshop I run.

There aren't necessarily a ton of jobs advertised as **GIS Analyst**, but there a wide range of applications for GIS! {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} # Government Many government positions, from municipal to federal, require GIS skills. ## Urban Planning {: .no_toc } Basic GIS and Cartography are essential for any city planner. Nearly every municipality has a planning department. City of Vancouver [Planning Department](https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/planning-zoning-development.aspx) - Zoning & Development - Accessibility - Sustainability ## Disaster Planning & Recovery {: .no_toc } British Columbia's floodplain maps are [**severely outdated**](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/water/drought-flooding-dikes-dams/integrated-flood-hazard-management/flood-hazard-land-use-management/floodplain-mapping/floodplain-maps-by-region), as are flood maps across the country. The province has \"offloaded\" responsibility of flood management [onto municipalities](https://youtu.be/o6ktS3Ex4TU), which is a grossly negligent action as the scale of the problem is far beyone what municipalities have the resources to address. Up to [10% of Canadian homes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-home-insurance-1.6262386) are in high risk flood zones. This largely needs to be addressed by provincial & federal governments (disasters don't respect borders). Beyond flooding ... there are many other looming issues we need to prepare for: - Fires - Windstorms - Earthquakes - Tsunamis - Volcanoes - Permafrost Thaw - Public Health - Migration Crises - War and Famine ## Conservation and Resource Management {: .no_toc } Provincial and Federal governments are responsible for managing resources, which requires managing maps and databases for: - Mining - Forestry - Fisheries - Agriculture # Private Sector ## Logistics {: .no_toc } Route mapping and optimization is largely done by algorithms, but experienced users are need at large companies like Google, FedEx, UPS, etc. to manage the applications. Global shipping and air carriers need geoanalysts as well. There many more specialized applications for navigation and logistics expertise. - The recent flooding in BC has highlighted how important logistics operators are in modern society. ## Resource Extraction & Development {: .no_toc } Closely tied with the government resource management, industries hire employees with GIS skills or contract consulting firms: - Mining - Forestry - Fisheries - Agriculture ## Consulting {: .no_toc } Beyond resource extraction, there are a number of other projects that rely on private consulting: - Environmental Impact Assessments - Construction and Real Estate Development - Political Consulting - Freelance Applications # Research and Advocacy ## Climate Change {: .no_toc } GIS has a wide range of applications for addressing climate change. Satellite data can be used to monitor impacts and advance our understanding. Mapping can be used to work towards mitigation and develop strategies for adaptation (eg. mapping sea level rise, risk assessments for highways, assessing fire risk). * I frequently use GIS in my own research, it was a central part of my dissertation and now I'm using it working for the UBC Micrometeorology research group. ## Social Justice {: .no_toc } GIS is a powerful tool for addressing social justice issues. Especially Open Source GIS, because access is not restricted licensing fees.
