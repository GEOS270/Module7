<h2 id="flowchart-50-pts-x1">Flowchart (50 pts x1)</h2>

<p>Tests your ability to work through a problem using GIS methods.  Create a flow chart outlining a GIS analysis in response to a prompt.  I suggest you use <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">diagrams.net</a> because its easy to create clean flowcharts quickly, but you can do it however youâ€™d like.  You might want to practice making a flowchart before exam time.</p>

<p>The processes youâ€™ll want to be familiar with were covered in <a href="https://geos270.github.io/Module5/">Module 5</a> &amp; <a href="https://geos270.github.io/Module6/">Module 6</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>When exporting to submit, make sure to export/submit a .png, .jpg, or .pdf</li>
  <li>Think about design principals - aesthetics will be a small portion of the flowchart grade.</li>
