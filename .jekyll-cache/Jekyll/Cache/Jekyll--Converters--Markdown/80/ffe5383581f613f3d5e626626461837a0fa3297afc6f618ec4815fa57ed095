<p>I‚Äôm going to give you a quick walk through of the geocoding notebook.  Your ‚ÄúLab‚Äù for this week is just to follow along through this tutorial and answer the respective questions.</p>

<h2 id="getting-setup-download-the-code-and-data">Getting Setup: Download the Code and Data</h2>

<p><strong class="label label-red">1</strong> <strong>Start a Jupyter Lab</strong></p>

<p>UBC provides server space where you can run Python using <a href="https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter">Jupyter Lab</a>.  Login with your CWL.  You‚Äôll then be taken to a blank jupyter lab.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is good option for getting your bearings because nearly everything is already set up. You don‚Äôt have to worry about installing anything on your own system.</li>
  <li>This may sound intimidating/confusing.  But don‚Äôt worry, its easy.  You don‚Äôt need to know command line to do this.  I‚Äôll walk you through step by step.  You can also refer to the video below for help</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-red">2</strong> <strong>Open a terminal</strong></p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to open a command terminal and use command line clone the Github workshop‚Äôs repository.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In they Jupyter window, click File&gt;‚ÄùNew‚Äù in the top right and select ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-red">3</strong> <strong>Clone the Repository</strong></p>

<p>Cloning tells Git (a file tracking software) to download a repository (collection of code, data, etc.) for this workshop.
In the new terminal window that opens, paste this command and hit enter:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/GEOS270/Module7
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A folder called Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python should now be visible.  You can explore it using file viewer on the left, or you can use the command line (see video).</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">4</strong> <strong>Installing a Package</strong></p>

<p>In the terminal window type the command below and hit enter to install the geopy package</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install geopy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong class="label label-red">5</strong>  <strong>Opening a Jupyter Notebook</strong></p>

<p>In the file viewer You will notice a folder with the same name as the repository you just cloned, double clicking the folder will open it.  You‚Äôll see a folders and a collection of files.  The one we‚Äôll be working in is called ‚ÄúPython_Notebooks‚Äù.  Double click to enter.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The .ipynb tag on the end denotes a Jupyter ‚ÄúNotebook‚Äù
    <ul>
      <li>A Notebook is a collection of Python code and annotations that can be run interactively.</li>
      <li>Double click on ‚ÄúGeocoding and Webmapping.ipynb‚Äù to open it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
