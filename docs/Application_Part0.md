# Redlining

During the course introduction I said that GIS has historically been used as a tool of oppression in settler societies.  What did I mean by that? 

* History is filled with examples of GISystems being used by those in power to influence, direct, or dictate polices and practices that harm marginalized communities.
* In some cases, the negative impacts are untended consequences.  In many others, the negative impact is the intended result.  

## A Prominent Historical Example

[Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) is the systematic denial of services to racially marginalized groups by government and lending institutions in order to forcibly segregated communities.  For much of the 20th century, redlining was legal and wide spread across North American cities.  The practice has been more thoroughly documented and researched in the US.

* The video below gives a thorough overview of the practice and how its negative impacts.
  * It is very important to note that [redlining occurred in Canada as well](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43100660).

In your own words, describe what the practice of redlining was and discuss some of its long lasting impacts?
